### Questions
```
4. Solve the following problems using the s(CASP) system. Please do not just use your
   Prolog code from prior homeworks and simply run it on s(CASP). Use even loops over negation 
   for generating worlds and constraints (or odd loops over negation) for killing worlds. 
   (Prolog uses member, select, etc., as generators; in ASP generators come from even loops).

   a.	Program the graph coloring problem in ASP (use the code discussed in class)
   b.	Program the block's world problem from HW 7 using ASP
   c.	Program the Missionary-Cannibal problem
